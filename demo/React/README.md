# Alpheios Embedded Library - React Component Demo

This example shows how to use the Alpheios Embedded Library in a React Component.

It is based upon code initially provided by Zach Fletcher, The Perseids Project .

Original source https://gist.github.com/zfletch/95dad830653dc4f039beca49842a463b

The example code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
